"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.","i have watched titanic how many times i don't know. everytime i watch it, i still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. the story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'my heart will go on' is perfect fit for jack and roses' love story and is timeless as well. all the movie's factors are fully qualified. what more can i say? it is the masterpiece.","i have watched titanic how many times i don't know. everytime i watch it, i still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. the story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'my heart will go on' is perfect fit for jack and roses' love story and is timeless as well. all the movie's factors are fully qualified. what more can i say? it is the masterpiece.",i have watched titanic how many times i don t know  everytime i watch it  i still cry  laugh  smile  and feel  the story flows with tension throughout the movie  two actors  acting and chemistry need applaud  sinking ship is realistically filmed   my heart will go on  is perfect fit for jack and roses  love story and is timeless as well  all the movie s factors are fully qualified  what more can i say  it is the masterpiece ,"watched titanic many times know. everytime watch it, still cry, laugh, smile, feel. story flows tension throughout movie; two actors' acting chemistry need applaud; sinking ship realistically filmed; 'my heart go on' perfect fit jack roses' love story timeless well. movie's factors fully qualified. say? masterpiece.","watched titanic many times know. everytime watch it, still cry, laugh, smile, feel. story flows tension throughout movie; two actors' acting chemistry need applaud; sinking ship realistically filled; 'my heart go on' perfect fit jack roses' love story tireless well. movie's factors fully qualified. say? masterpiece.","['watched', 'titanic', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'everytime', 'watch', 'it', 'still', 'cry', 'laugh', 'smile', 'feel', 'story', 'flows', 'tension', 'throughout', 'movie', 'two', 'actors', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'need', 'applaud', 'sinking', 'ship', 'realistically', 'filled', ""'my"", 'heart', 'go', 'on', 'perfect', 'fit', 'jack', 'roses', 'love', 'story', 'tireless', 'well', 'movie', ""'s"", 'factors', 'fully', 'qualified', 'say', 'masterpiece']",watch titan mani time know everytim watch it still cri laugh smile feel stori flow tension throughout movi two actor act chemistri need applaud sink ship realist fill 'mi heart go on perfect fit jack rose love stori tireless well movi 's factor fulli qualifi say masterpiec,watch titan mani time know everytim watch it still cri laugh smile feel stori flow tension throughout movi two actor act chemistri need applaud sink ship realist fill 'mi heart go on perfect fit jack rose love stori tireless well movi 's factor fulli qualifi say masterpiec
"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.","the stage curtains open ...not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""braveheart"", have i ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as i was with ""titanic"". i knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but i had no idea the ride i was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. i have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that i've read/heard when it come to this epic film. because, it is just that -

"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story.

"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10","back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess

the film since i was 14, a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now. was it worth the hype? was it really the best movie of all time? was that leonardo's real nose? ok, i know that's silly to say, but i did re-watch the film. being completely honest here, titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean. unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the heart of the ocean, dated the day the titanic sank. 101-year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic, revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater. in 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, cal hockley and her desperate for money mother, ruth dewitt bukater. distraught and frustrated by her engagement, rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. before she leaps, a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. after revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.so does titanic live up to it's hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch, i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and leo mania was born at the time. everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. it has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. otherwise i don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. kate and leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, i think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. james cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. james had captured everything about titanic and the sinking so well. he respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. he had every right in my opinion to scream ""i'm king of the world!"" at the oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? i'm going to admit it, i love titanic, even past my teen years i absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. i do recommend titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10","back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess diana, the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. this was also the big year in the release of titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of

"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story.

"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.",good lord  this movie right here  it s a masterpiece  i am not exaggerating when i say this  tonight was the first time i watched this  i watched some parts of it earlier  but i thought it would probably be boring  and that i had better things to do  tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother  i was completely wrong on that  this was the best movie that i ve ever seen  and probably ever will see in my entire life  me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it  there were two scenes which made me cry  the part where the orchestra played  nearer  my god  to thee  and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack  this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again ,"good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggerating say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggeration say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","['good', 'lord', 'movie', 'right', 'here', 'masterpiece', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'this', 'tonight', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'this', 'watched', 'parts', 'earlier', 'thought', 'would', 'probably', 'boring', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'tonight', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'grandmother', 'completely', 'wrong', 'that', 'best', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'ever', 'see', 'entire', 'life', 'grandmother', 'tears', 'end', 'it', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'cry', 'part', 'orchestra', 'played', 'nearer', 'god', 'thee', 'end', 'perished', 'titanic', 'applaud', 'kiss', 'rose', 'jack', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again,good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again

"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.","""based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" it's

"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope

"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.","i avoided watching this film for the longest time. long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz, and i wanted nothing to do with it. i never watched it in the theatre. i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it. then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. one of the girls spoke about this movie.

"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other.

"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.","if you're a millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'titanic-mania' during your childhood,

"This movie re-wrote film history in every way.  No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.  Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.  It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.

"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.","from ""cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""titanic"" in 1953, ""a night to remember"" in 1957 and ""the unsinkable molly brown"" in 1964, the doom ship titanic became a

"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.","james cameron's 'titanic' shares a similar motto to marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", i for

"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty

whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes

"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.","firstly and foremostly, i am a guy, which (in most cases) means i did not go see titanic to see dicaprio...although i think he can be a great actor. reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. i went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the cake. i actually think a lot of the characters were done well;

"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.","the stage curtains open ...not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""braveheart"", have i ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as i was with ""titanic"". i knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but i had no idea the ride i was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. i have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that i've read/heard when it come to this epic film. because, it is just that -

"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship.

"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10","back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess

for money mother, ruth dewitt bukater. distraught and frustrated by her engagement, rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. before she leaps, a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. after revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.so does titanic live up to it's hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch, i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and leo mania was born at the time. everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. it has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. otherwise i don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. kate and leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, i think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. james cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. james had captured everything about titanic and the sinking so well. he respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. he had every right in my opinion to scream ""i'm king of the world!"" at the oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? i'm going to admit it, i love titanic, even past my teen years i absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. i do recommend titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",back in 1997  do i remember that year  clinton bans cloning research  the unfortunate death of princess diana  the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets  this was also the big year in the release of titanic  one of the biggest films of all time  a tale about the ship of dreams  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster  i don t think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans  85  of them being teenage girls  i was 12 years old at the time  and of course saw the movie multiple times  it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful  at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong  of course i grew up and didn t watch the film since i was 14  a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now  was it worth the hype  was it really the best movie of all time  was that leonardo s real nose  ok  i know that s silly to say  but i did re watch the film  being completely honest here  titanic is a great movie  it delivered in romance  humor  disaster  emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean  unsuccessful  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the heart of the ocean  dated the day the titanic sank  101 year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing  and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing  when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater  in 1912  the upper class 17 year old rose boards the ship with her controlling fianc   cal hockley and her desperate for money mother  ruth dewitt bukater  distraught and frustrated by her engagement  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern  before she leaps  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes who convinces her

"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history  james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages  it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again  from the directing  beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion  not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story  romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this  worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema  it is loved universally and it is truly timeless ,"titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song celine dion. masterful depiction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rated genre takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy oscars revenue film etched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly timeless.","titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song line don. wasteful deduction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rate gene takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy scars revenue film fetched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly tireless.","['titanic', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'history', 'james', 'cameron', 'outdone', 'epic', 'film', 'clearly', 'one', 'ages', 'perfect', 'almost', 'every', 'way', 'watched', 'again', 'directing', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'immortal', 'song', 'line', 'don', 'wasteful', 'deduction', 'sinking', 'titanic', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'romance', 'lowest', 'rate', 'gene', 'takes', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'love', 'story', 'like', 'titanic', 'showcased', 'this', 'worthy', 'scars', 'revenue', 'film', 'fetched', 'one', 'great', 'triumphs', 'cinema', 'loved', 'universally', 'truly', 'tireless']",titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless,titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless
"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother.

"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world.

"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.","""based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" it's

"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either.

"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.","i avoided watching this film for the longest time. long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz, and i wanted nothing to do with it. i never watched it in the theatre. i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it. then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. one of the girls spoke about this movie.

"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing.

"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.","titanic is one of my all time favourite films. i'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since i was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. we all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'i thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: i cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like fabrizio and murdoch the first officer and countless more. it was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. you remember jack telling rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. the irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. the violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. and the music!

"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film.

"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.","if you're a millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'titanic-mania' during your childhood,

"This movie re-wrote film history in every way.  No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.  Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.  It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.

"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.)

That is what makes an instant classic.","from ""cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""titanic"" in 1953, ""a night to remember"" in 1957 and ""the unsinkable molly brown"" in 1964, the doom ship titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a tv movie, a broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. the reason is clear: james cameron, kate winslet and leonardo dicaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a celine dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.this is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor rose calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress gloria stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. the nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more titanic artifacts and stories. arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.from there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. winslet is engaged to the vain billy zane, forced by her desperate mother (frances fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche kathy bates, and when she meets jack dawson (dicaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. dawson has saved young roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.with real life titanic passengers brown, john jacob astor and his wife madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), benjamin guggenheim and isadore and ida strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. zane and his humorless right hand man (david warner) are great villains, with zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. watching zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.the film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as dicaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love winslet, struggles to be set free. it goes on a bit too

"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.","james cameron's 'titanic' shares a similar motto to marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", i for

"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list","titanic

"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.","firstly and foremostly, i am a guy, which (in most cases) means i did not go see titanic to see dicaprio...although i think he can be a great actor. reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. i went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the cake. i actually think a lot of the characters were done well;

"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.","i have watched titanic how many times i don't know. everytime i watch it, i still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. the story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'my heart will go on' is perfect fit for jack and roses' love story and is timeless as well. all the movie's factors are fully qualified. what more can i say? it is the masterpiece.","i have watched titanic how many times i don't know. everytime i watch it, i still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. the story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'my heart will go on' is perfect fit for jack and roses' love story and is timeless as well. all the movie's factors are fully qualified. what more can i say? it is the masterpiece.",i have watched titanic how many times i don t know  everytime i watch it  i still cry  laugh  smile  and feel  the story flows with tension throughout the movie  two actors  acting and chemistry need applaud  sinking ship is realistically filmed   my heart will go on  is perfect fit for jack and roses  love story and is timeless as well  all the movie s factors are fully qualified  what more can i say  it is the masterpiece ,"watched titanic many times know. everytime watch it, still cry, laugh, smile, feel. story flows tension throughout movie; two actors' acting chemistry need applaud; sinking ship realistically filmed; 'my heart go on' perfect fit jack roses' love story timeless well. movie's factors fully qualified. say? masterpiece.","watched titanic many times know. everytime watch it, still cry, laugh, smile, feel. story flows tension throughout movie; two actors' acting chemistry need applaud; sinking ship realistically filled; 'my heart go on' perfect fit jack roses' love story tireless well. movie's factors fully qualified. say? masterpiece.","['watched', 'titanic', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'everytime', 'watch', 'it', 'still', 'cry', 'laugh', 'smile', 'feel', 'story', 'flows', 'tension', 'throughout', 'movie', 'two', 'actors', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'need', 'applaud', 'sinking', 'ship', 'realistically', 'filled', ""'my"", 'heart', 'go', 'on', 'perfect', 'fit', 'jack', 'roses', 'love', 'story', 'tireless', 'well', 'movie', ""'s"", 'factors', 'fully', 'qualified', 'say', 'masterpiece']",watch titan mani time know everytim watch it still cri laugh smile feel stori flow tension throughout movi two actor act chemistri need applaud sink ship realist fill 'mi heart go on perfect fit jack rose love stori tireless well movi 's factor fulli qualifi say masterpiec,watch titan mani time know everytim watch it still cri laugh smile feel stori flow tension throughout movi two actor act chemistri need applaud sink ship realist fill 'mi heart go on perfect fit jack rose love stori tireless well movi 's factor fulli qualifi say masterpiec
"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.","the stage curtains open ...not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""braveheart"", have i ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as i was with ""titanic"". i knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but i had no idea the ride i was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. i have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that i've read/heard when it come to this epic film. because, it is just that -

"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story.

"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10","back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess

love it or hate it  you have to admit this movie didn t get a lot of hype just because of leo s baby face or kate s amazing ability to cry on sight  this film is something special  otherwise i don t think we d still be talking about it so many years later  kate and leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time  despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot  i think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together  james cameron  the extreme perfectionist that he is  went over time and money budgets for titanic  but this was his baby and it paid off very well  james had captured everything about titanic and the sinking so well  he respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn t just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage  he had every right in my opinion to scream  i m king of the world   at the oscars  because this movie blew everyone out of the water no pun intended   you know what  i m going to admit it  i love titanic  even past my teen years i absolutely adore this movie  it will always hold a special place in my heart  it has too since i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released  remember one thing  be true to yourself  don t follow the crowd  lovers or haters  if you go with the hype you re always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it  then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever  i do recommend titanic  it s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day 10 10,"back 1997, remember year: clinton bans cloning research, unfortunate death princess diana, marlins world series

"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history  james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages  it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again  from the directing  beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion  not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story  romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this  worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema  it is loved universally and it is truly timeless ,"titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song celine dion. masterful depiction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rated genre takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy oscars revenue film etched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly timeless.","titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song line don. wasteful deduction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rate gene takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy scars revenue film fetched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly tireless.","['titanic', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'history', 'james', 'cameron', 'outdone', 'epic', 'film', 'clearly', 'one', 'ages', 'perfect', 'almost', 'every', 'way', 'watched', 'again', 'directing', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'immortal', 'song', 'line', 'don', 'wasteful', 'deduction', 'sinking', 'titanic', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'romance', 'lowest', 'rate', 'gene', 'takes', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'love', 'story', 'like', 'titanic', 'showcased', 'this', 'worthy', 'scars', 'revenue', 'film', 'fetched', 'one', 'great', 'triumphs', 'cinema', 'loved', 'universally', 'truly', 'tireless']",titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless,titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless
"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this.

I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.",good lord  this movie right here  it s a masterpiece  i am not exaggerating when i say this  tonight was the first time i watched this  i watched some parts of it earlier  but i thought it would probably be boring  and that i had better things to do  tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother  i was completely wrong on that  this was the best movie that i ve ever seen  and probably ever will see in my entire life  me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it  there were two scenes which made me cry  the part where the orchestra played  nearer  my god  to thee  and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack  this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again ,"good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggerating say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggeration say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","['good', 'lord', 'movie', 'right', 'here', 'masterpiece', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'this', 'tonight', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'this', 'watched', 'parts', 'earlier', 'thought', 'would', 'probably', 'boring', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'tonight', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'grandmother', 'completely', 'wrong', 'that', 'best', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'ever', 'see', 'entire', 'life', 'grandmother', 'tears', 'end', 'it', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'cry', 'part', 'orchestra', 'played', 'nearer', 'god', 'thee', 'end', 'perished', 'titanic', 'applaud', 'kiss', 'rose', 'jack', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again,good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again
"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic.""

"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy.

"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope

"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.","i avoided watching this film for the longest time. long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz, and i wanted nothing to do with it. i never watched it in the theatre. i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it. then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. one of the girls spoke about this movie.

"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen.

Well worth seeing once.","""titanic"" won a bazillion oscars and is considered a classic by many. and, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. so, what more can i say about this film that hasn't already been said? well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.i give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. but, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. after all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. so, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. and, now that i think about this, this is exactly how i viewed director cameron's other huge success, ""avatar"". well worth seeing once.","""titanic"" won a bazillion oscars and is considered a classic by many. and, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. so, what more can i say about this film that hasn't already been said?

"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.","titanic is one of my all time favourite films. i'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since i was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. we all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'i thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: i cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like fabrizio and murdoch the first officer and countless more. it was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. you remember jack telling rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. the irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. the violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. and the music!

"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.","if you're a millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'titanic-mania' during your childhood,

"This movie re-wrote film history in every way.  No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.  Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.  It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.

"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.","from ""cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""titanic"" in 1953, ""a night to remember"" in 1957 and ""the unsinkable molly brown"" in 1964, the doom ship titanic became a

"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.","james cameron's 'titanic' shares a similar motto to marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", i for

"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty

whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes

"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.","firstly and foremostly, i am a guy, which (in most cases) means i did not go see titanic to see dicaprio...although i think he can be a great actor. reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. i went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the cake. i actually think a lot of the characters were done well;

he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get out of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail. i like detail in a movie. very impressive job.","firstly and foremostly, i am a guy, which (in most cases) means i did not go see titanic to see dicaprio...although i think he can be a great actor. reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. i went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the cake. i actually think a lot of the characters were done well;

"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel.

"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.","the stage curtains open ...not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""braveheart"", have i ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as i was with ""titanic"". i knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but i had no idea the ride i was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. i have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that i've read/heard when it come to this epic film. because, it is just that -

"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10","back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess

"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history  james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages  it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again  from the directing  beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion  not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story  romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this  worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema  it is loved universally and it is truly timeless ,"titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song celine dion. masterful depiction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rated genre takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy oscars revenue film etched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly timeless.","titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song line don. wasteful deduction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rate gene takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy scars revenue film fetched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly tireless.","['titanic', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'history', 'james', 'cameron', 'outdone', 'epic', 'film', 'clearly', 'one', 'ages', 'perfect', 'almost', 'every', 'way', 'watched', 'again', 'directing', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'immortal', 'song', 'line', 'don', 'wasteful', 'deduction', 'sinking', 'titanic', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'romance', 'lowest', 'rate', 'gene', 'takes', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'love', 'story', 'like', 'titanic', 'showcased', 'this', 'worthy', 'scars', 'revenue', 'film', 'fetched', 'one', 'great', 'triumphs', 'cinema', 'loved', 'universally', 'truly', 'tireless']",titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless,titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless
"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.",good lord  this movie right here  it s a masterpiece  i am not exaggerating when i say this  tonight was the first time i watched this  i watched some parts of it earlier  but i thought it would probably be boring  and that i had better things to do  tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother  i was completely wrong on that  this was the best movie that i ve ever seen  and probably ever will see in my entire life  me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it  there were two scenes which made me cry  the part where the orchestra played  nearer  my god  to thee  and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack  this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again ,"good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggerating say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggeration say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","['good', 'lord', 'movie', 'right', 'here', 'masterpiece', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'this', 'tonight', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'this', 'watched', 'parts', 'earlier', 'thought', 'would', 'probably', 'boring', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'tonight', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'grandmother', 'completely', 'wrong', 'that', 'best', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'ever', 'see', 'entire', 'life', 'grandmother', 'tears', 'end', 'it', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'cry', 'part', 'orchestra', 'played', 'nearer', 'god', 'thee', 'end', 'perished', 'titanic', 'applaud', 'kiss', 'rose', 'jack', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again,good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again

"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.","""based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" it's

interpretation of how society worked at the time. jack and rose, as well as being beautifully played by dicaprio and winslet, are incredibly well crafted. they are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. it's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. it's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. summed up, titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.", based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories  comes this fake one   it s time to decide  was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of james cameron to throw two made up passengers who fall in love onto the ship  or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of april 15th  1912  without a doubt  the latter  the fictional story of jack and rose never distracts from the tragic true story  it cinematically enhances it  we never ever miss the bigger picture first of all  just look at this film  the resplendent wonder of the film s set design  both interior and exterior  places you right on board  it looks and feels the part  and when the inevitable disaster strikes  cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail  the sinking of the titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects  it makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie i ve seen however  a roland emmerich or michael bay film this is not  as cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it  watching the titanic being destroyed is not fun or  in its broadest sense  exciting   it s intensely distressing  unlike most disaster films  it never feels like we re watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around  the lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period  such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character  and when the ship sinks  it genuinely shocks you to see them go  for a good part of the sinking  jack and rose s fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side  giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night so aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real life tragedy  what does the story of jack

"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope

"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie.

"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?

"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998.

"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.","titanic is one of my all time favourite films. i'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since i was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. we all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'i thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: i cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like fabrizio and murdoch the first officer and countless more. it was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. you remember jack telling rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. the irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. the violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. and the music!

"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.","if you're a millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'titanic-mania' during your childhood,

between 8-20 was obsessed with leonardo dicaprio. titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. despite winning numerous oscars, titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.in hindsight, if you had your image of titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, i highly suggest you give it another go. it really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. the special effects are second to none, the acting is great and james horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. both rose and jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.my advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'titanic sucks', is to

"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.","from ""cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""titanic"" in 1953, ""a night to remember"" in 1957 and ""the unsinkable molly brown"" in 1964, the doom ship titanic became a

"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.","james cameron's 'titanic' shares a similar motto to marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", i for

"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list","titanic

"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.","firstly and foremostly, i am a guy, which (in most cases) means i did not go see titanic to see dicaprio...although i think he can be a great actor. reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. i went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the cake. i actually think a lot of the characters were done well;

"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.","i have watched titanic how many times i don't know. everytime i watch it, i still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. the story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'my heart will go on' is perfect fit for jack and roses' love story and is timeless as well. all the movie's factors are fully qualified. what more can i say? it is the masterpiece.","i have watched titanic how many times i don't know. everytime i watch it, i still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. the story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'my heart will go on' is perfect fit for jack and roses' love story and is timeless as well. all the movie's factors are fully qualified. what more can i say? it is the masterpiece.",i have watched titanic how many times i don t know  everytime i watch it  i still cry  laugh  smile  and feel  the story flows with tension throughout the movie  two actors  acting and chemistry need applaud  sinking ship is realistically filmed   my heart will go on  is perfect fit for jack and roses  love story and is timeless as well  all the movie s factors are fully qualified  what more can i say  it is the masterpiece ,"watched titanic many times know. everytime watch it, still cry, laugh, smile, feel. story flows tension throughout movie; two actors' acting chemistry need applaud; sinking ship realistically filmed; 'my heart go on' perfect fit jack roses' love story timeless well. movie's factors fully qualified. say? masterpiece.","watched titanic many times know. everytime watch it, still cry, laugh, smile, feel. story flows tension throughout movie; two actors' acting chemistry need applaud; sinking ship realistically filled; 'my heart go on' perfect fit jack roses' love story tireless well. movie's factors fully qualified. say? masterpiece.","['watched', 'titanic', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'everytime', 'watch', 'it', 'still', 'cry', 'laugh', 'smile', 'feel', 'story', 'flows', 'tension', 'throughout', 'movie', 'two', 'actors', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'need', 'applaud', 'sinking', 'ship', 'realistically', 'filled', ""'my"", 'heart', 'go', 'on', 'perfect', 'fit', 'jack', 'roses', 'love', 'story', 'tireless', 'well', 'movie', ""'s"", 'factors', 'fully', 'qualified', 'say', 'masterpiece']",watch titan mani time know everytim watch it still cri laugh smile feel stori flow tension throughout movi two actor act chemistri need applaud sink ship realist fill 'mi heart go on perfect fit jack rose love stori tireless well movi 's factor fulli qualifi say masterpiec,watch titan mani time know everytim watch it still cri laugh smile feel stori flow tension throughout movi two actor act chemistri need applaud sink ship realist fill 'mi heart go on perfect fit jack rose love stori tireless well movi 's factor fulli qualifi say masterpiec
"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.","the stage curtains open ...not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""braveheart"", have i ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as i was with ""titanic"". i knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but i had no idea the ride i was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. i have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that i've read/heard when it come to this epic film. because, it is just that -

"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship.

"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10","back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess diana, the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. this was also the big year in the release of titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, i was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple

"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.","titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. from the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion. not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story. romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this. worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. it is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history  james cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages  it is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again  from the directing  beautiful photography and an immortal song by celine dion  not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the titanic but a great love story  romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and titanic showcased this  worthy of all its oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema  it is loved universally and it is truly timeless ,"titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song celine dion. masterful depiction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rated genre takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy oscars revenue film etched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly timeless.","titanic true masterpiece easily one greatest films history. james cameron outdone epic film clearly one ages. perfect almost every way watched again. directing, beautiful photography immortal song line don. wasteful deduction sinking titanic great love story. romance lowest rate gene takes really well made love story like titanic showcased this. worthy scars revenue film fetched one great triumphs cinema. loved universally truly tireless.","['titanic', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'easily', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'history', 'james', 'cameron', 'outdone', 'epic', 'film', 'clearly', 'one', 'ages', 'perfect', 'almost', 'every', 'way', 'watched', 'again', 'directing', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'immortal', 'song', 'line', 'don', 'wasteful', 'deduction', 'sinking', 'titanic', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'romance', 'lowest', 'rate', 'gene', 'takes', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'love', 'story', 'like', 'titanic', 'showcased', 'this', 'worthy', 'scars', 'revenue', 'film', 'fetched', 'one', 'great', 'triumphs', 'cinema', 'loved', 'universally', 'truly', 'tireless']",titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless,titan true masterpiec easili one greatest film histori jame cameron outdon epic film clearli one age perfect almost everi way watch again direct beauti photographi immort song line don wast deduct sink titan great love stori romanc lowest rate gene take realli well made love stori like titan showcas thi worthi scar revenu film fetch one great triumph cinema love univers truli tireless
"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.","good lord. this movie right here, it's a masterpiece. i am not exaggerating when i say this. tonight was the first time i watched this. i watched some parts of it earlier, but i thought it would probably be boring, and that i had better things to do. tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother. i was completely wrong on that. this was the best movie that i've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. there were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""nearer, my god, to thee"" and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack. this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again.",good lord  this movie right here  it s a masterpiece  i am not exaggerating when i say this  tonight was the first time i watched this  i watched some parts of it earlier  but i thought it would probably be boring  and that i had better things to do  tonight i watched the whole thing with my grandmother  i was completely wrong on that  this was the best movie that i ve ever seen  and probably ever will see in my entire life  me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it  there were two scenes which made me cry  the part where the orchestra played  nearer  my god  to thee  and the end when all those perished on the titanic applaud at the kiss of rose and jack  this movie was absolutely amazing and i would watch it over and over again ,"good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggerating say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","good lord. movie right here, masterpiece. exaggeration say this. tonight first time watched this. watched parts earlier, thought would probably boring, better things do. tonight watched whole thing grandmother. completely wrong that. best movie i've ever seen, probably ever see entire life. grandmother tears end it. two scenes made cry: part orchestra played ""nearer, god, thee"" end perished titanic applaud kiss rose jack. movie absolutely amazing would watch again.","['good', 'lord', 'movie', 'right', 'here', 'masterpiece', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'this', 'tonight', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'this', 'watched', 'parts', 'earlier', 'thought', 'would', 'probably', 'boring', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'tonight', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'grandmother', 'completely', 'wrong', 'that', 'best', 'movie', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'probably', 'ever', 'see', 'entire', 'life', 'grandmother', 'tears', 'end', 'it', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'cry', 'part', 'orchestra', 'played', 'nearer', 'god', 'thee', 'end', 'perished', 'titanic', 'applaud', 'kiss', 'rose', 'jack', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again,good lord movi right here masterpiec exagger say thi tonight first time watch thi watch part earlier thought would probabl bore better thing do tonight watch whole thing grandmoth complet wrong that best movi i 've ever seen probabl ever see entir life grandmoth tear end it two scene made cri part orchestra play nearer god thee end perish titan applaud kiss rose jack movi absolut amaz would watch again

"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.","""based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" it's

"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope

"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.","i avoided watching this film for the longest time. long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz, and i wanted nothing to do with it. i never watched it in the theatre. i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it. then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. one of the girls spoke about this movie.

"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.","titanic is one of my all time favourite films. i'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since i was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. we all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'i thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: i cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like fabrizio and murdoch the first officer and countless more. it was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. you remember jack telling rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. the irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. the violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. and the music!

"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.","i am still crying as i am writing this review as of right now. i don't even
